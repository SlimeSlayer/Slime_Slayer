- va_list 
	
You can't use va_arg(va_list, float) because the types are promoted to double; 
you must use va_arg(va_list, double). 
Similarly, short and char types are promoted to int and must be retrieved using int.

Call va_start to fill a va_list whit the ellipsis next the specified var va_start(va_list,var)
Call va_end when you end with the variables to close up the list
